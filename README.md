Cyber-Hack
==========

The Cyber@Hack is an CTF organized by Epitech Toulouse and iTrust.
The first edition took place on April 10th of 2014, at Epitech Toulouse (France). The event was composed of different parts, there were talks and conferences during the afternoon. Then the CTF took place for a short time (too short, 4 hours).

This repository contains the challenges that have been released at Cyber@Hack. We were releasing challenges from a category only if their previous challenge was beaten by a team.
